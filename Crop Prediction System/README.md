## About the project:
<p align="justify">Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the Indian economy and India ranks second
worldwide in farm outputs. Since India is the second most populated country in the world we
cannot afford to make mistakes when it comes to the agricultural field. But, one of the common
mistakes made by the farmer is not choosing an appropriate crop for the soil. This prediction model
helps to recommend the most suitable crop to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters
like nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, the temperature in degree Celsius, humidity, pH of the soil,
rainfall in mm. It is a machine learning project and the dataset is a CSV file containing all the
above-mentioned parameters. This predictive model can be implemented using different
classification algorithms in Machine learning using python. Since ensemble algorithms are expected
to give better efficiency and produce optimal predictions in the case of large samples of data, we
can use them to build our prediction model. On giving an array containing values of different
parameters mentioned above as input we get a single-element array containing the name of the crop
that best suits the soil with given parameters.</p>
 
 
 
 ## Steps to run the project
 Step 1: Download crop recommendation dataset from Kaggle using this link: \
 https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset 
 
 Step 2: Create a new python notebook in Google Collaboratory and import the ipynb notebook
 from the git repository:
 https://github.com/Neha-Reddy-Karnati/Projects/tree/main/Crop%20Prediction%20System/notebook 
 
 Step 3: Run all cells and save the model. 
 
 Step 4: Install Flask by running the following command in the command prompt. \
 pip install Flask 
 
 Step 5: Download and Install Visual Studio Code from the following link: \
 https://code.visualstudio.com/download 
 
 Step 6: Download and import the project from the following git repository: \
