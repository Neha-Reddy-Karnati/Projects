## About the project:

 Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment. Visually impaired
 people find it difficult to self-navigate outside well-known environments. It affects their ability
 to perform several jobs, duties, and activities. They are dependent on external assistance which
 can be provided by humans or special electronic devices for better decision making. In this
 proposed system we develop a walk-mate that is a special stick that helps the visually impaired
 self-navigate without any assistance. This proposed system will include features such as obstacle
 detection by using ultrasonic sensors and an emergency button that helps the visually impaired
 send a message to emergency contacts. The proposed system can be accessible to people so that
 the visually impaired will feel a sense of independence as they do not need to depend on others
 for assistance.
